# **Student Loan Recommendation System**
This project is a **machine learning-based recommendation system** designed to help students find suitable loan options based on their financial and academic profiles. The system uses **context-based filtering** to personalize loan recommendations.

## **Project Overview**
### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a **deep learning model** to predict credit ranking and recommend appropriate student loan options.

### **Key Features**
- Preprocesses student financial and academic data.
- Trains a deep learning model to predict loan eligibility.
- Implements a **context-based filtering** approach for loan recommendations.
- Ensures **data security** and mitigates **bias in loan suggestions**.
- Provides **insights** on financial aid options and repayment plans.

## **Dataset**
### **Source**
The dataset contains various student attributes and loan-related parameters.

### **Key Features in the Dataset**
- **Student Profile Data**: Income level, credit score, employment status, scholarships, etc.
- **Loan-Specific Data**: Loan amount, interest rates, repayment terms, eligibility criteria.
- **Behavioral & Preference Data**: Risk tolerance, preferred repayment plan, loan awareness.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (Data Processing)
  - `tensorflow` & `keras` (Deep Learning Model)
  - `sklearn` (Data Preprocessing & Model Evaluation)
- **Framework**: Jupyter Notebook

---

## **Project Workflow**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Load and clean the dataset.
- Standardize numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets.

### **2. Model Development**
- Define a **Sequential Deep Learning Model**.
- Train the model with **50 epochs** and optimize using `Adam`.
- Evaluate the model on test data using accuracy and loss metrics.

### **3. Loan Recommendation System**
- Predict **credit ranking** based on student financial data.
- Implement **context-based filtering** to suggest loans.
- Provide a classification report to assess model performance.

## **Challenges & Solutions**
### **1. Data Privacy and Security**
- **Concern**: Student loan recommendations involve **sensitive financial data**.
- **Solution**: Implement **encryption**, **secure authentication**, and **data anonymization**.

### **2. Fairness and Bias in Loan Recommendations**
- **Concern**: Algorithms may unintentionally **disadvantage low-income students**.
- **Solution**: Conduct **bias audits**, ensure **fair loan eligibility criteria**, and offer **financial education resources**.
